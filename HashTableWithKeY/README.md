# HashTableWithKeY

KeY verification case study in which we look at two collision resolution strategies. 
The two strategies are separate chaining and open addressing with linear probing.
For each strategy we looked at four versions using different types of keys and values and methods to compare keys.
The proofs we were able to finish are all done automatically by the KeY tool using version 2.8.0.
We used “Java verif. std.” as proof search strategy, and only the Taclet we changed was methodExpansion to noRestriction.
